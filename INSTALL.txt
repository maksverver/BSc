To install the testing framework, do the following:
 - extract the GIT code into a project root directory
 - extract the NIPS VM code into a subdirectory of the root called "nips_vm"
 - extract the NIPS PROMELA Compiler code into a subdirectory called "nips_c"
 - Run "make" in the "nips_vm" diretory
 - Run "ant" in the "nips_c" directory
 - Run "make" in the project root directory

Note that the NIPS PROMELA Compiler (and the Java SDK and Apache Ant) is only 
needed to compile the Promela models to NIPS VM format. Perl is needed to
execute the NIPS assembler. Instead of installing these dependencies, binary
bytecode files of the models can be used.
