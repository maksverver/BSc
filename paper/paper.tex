\section{Introduction}
% Copy and shorten introduction from proposal
% -> Motivate research into cache-efficient algorithms
% -> Move "classification" subsection describing three models to front
% -> Describe each of the three models
% -> Finally, present goal of the research (incorporate "Research Questions" in proposal)

% Marielle suggested:
%  - give the "standard" memory model an explicit name
%  - move example of cache oblivious data structures to front
%  - mention examples of cache unaware and cache aware algorithms

Text here will be mostly copied from the proposal.
